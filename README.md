# Project Title : Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

One of my favorite apps is Google Keep. I like it because of the simplicity and its accessible from almost anywhere. This project is going to be my attempt at making a similar app that I can use for taking notes and organizing my thoughts. The final app should be able to retrieve saved notes, add new notes, and delete old notes.

## Heroku link
https://morning-tor-88290.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
install node.js, run npm init, run npm i. The live version of this application will be deployed with Heroku. The frontend was already created in the homework folder, so my job is to create the backend code, and deploy the app. I copied the project from the homework template folder. There is a package.json included so I use npm install to install the dependencies.
